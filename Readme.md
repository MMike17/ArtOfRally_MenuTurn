## Requirements

Latest release [![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MMike17/ArtOfRally_MenuTurn?label=Menu%20turn)](https://github.com/MMike17/ArtOfRally_MenuTurn/releases/latest)

## Usage

Press Ctrl + F10 to open the mod manager menu.\
Adjust settings to change how the cars behave in menus.\

By default, the mod rotates cars automatically in menus, interrupts that behaviour on player input and resumes it after 2 seconds.

- **rotationSpeed** : speed at which the cars will turn in menus.
- **reverseRotation** : reverses the direction in which cars will turn towards.
- **rotationDelay** : delay, after a player input, before the car starts turning automatically again.

Disabling the mod in the manager will reinstate the default game behaviour.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/) of
the Unity Mod Manager.\
Then simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/MMike17/ArtOfRally_MenuTurn/releases/latest)
and drop it into the mod manager's mods page.
